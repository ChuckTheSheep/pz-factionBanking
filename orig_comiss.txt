I'm interested in commissioning a mod that is sort of a "group bank" type of thing. 

The goal is to be able to have players, either by faction or safehouse (those who can access it) be able to deposit Base.
Money into the bank and every x-number of days the bank issues y-value of interest on the funds in the bank. 

Purpose: We run base defense style events using your shops & traders mod for the event economy.
Allowing players to purchase items and equipment they need along the way.
We also reward them for planning ahead for the later more difficult waves for the base defense, 
and the group bank with interest earned on their deposits is one of the main ways we do this.

Parameters:
> Needs to be compatible with Shops & Traders (your mod)
> Needs to be placeable only by admins (your system for shops & Traders is great)
> Needs to have parameters which are editable such as:
-- 1) Minimum value/threshold before interest starts getting earned ($1000 minimum balance)
	...and will stop paying interest if the value falls below the threshold value.
-- 2) Admins are able to set the % interest value that gets paid out.
-- 3) Admins are able to set the day (or game hour) increments between the interest being paid by the bank.
> Access to the group bank can be locked to faction members or open to anyone (admins can set this)

Preference would be that it operates similarly to your shops & traders in terms of setup 
-- being able to select any container/location was very nice. Again... we love that mod.
